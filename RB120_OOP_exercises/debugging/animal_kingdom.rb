# FURTHER EXPLORATION

# Is the FlightlessBird#initialize method necessary? Why or why not?

# No, it is not. When a `FlightlessBird` object is created, because within the `FlightlessBird#initialize` method we're just calling `super`, the method lookup path essentially just calls the `Animal#initialize` method, and there are no additional expressions that are being evaluated within `FlightlessBird#initialize`.
